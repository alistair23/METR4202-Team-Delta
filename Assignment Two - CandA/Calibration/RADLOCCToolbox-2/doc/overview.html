<h1>Description and Usage Instructions</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The Robust Automatic Detection in Laser Of Calibration Chessboards
(RADLOCC) toolbox allows for the automatic extrinsic laser-camera calibration.
The toolbox provides the RADLOCC algorithm which automatically extracts the
calibration board lines from the laser scan. This algorithm was added onto the
original Laser-Camera Calibration Toolbox by Fabio Ramos and James Underwood.
The calibration process used in the toolbox is based on the paper by Pless and
Zhang. The method requires a calibration plane (such as a chessboard) to act as
a common dataset between the laser range finder and the camera. The points in
the laser scans corresponding to the calibration plane need to be selected.
Using the RADLOCC algorithm, these points are extracted automatically. The
toolbox assumes that the intrinisc parameters already exist. For automatic
camera calibration check the RADOCC toolbox.</strong></p>

<h2>CONTENTS<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The toolbox provides the following functionality:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Automatic selection of board lines.</li>
  <li>Automatic guess of initial estimate (manual input of initial estimate is
    also possible).</li>
  <li>Optional manual selection of board lines.</li>
  <li>Extrinsic laser-camera calibration.</li>
  <li>Calibration error analysis and improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The toolbox provides a GUI for the user's convenience.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The toolbox has the following requirements:</strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li>The toolbox assumes that camera calibration has already been performed.
    Refer to the RADOCC toolbox for automatic camera calibration. </li>
  <li>The toolbox relies on a calibration plane to act as a common dataset
    between the camera and the laser range finder. It is assumed that the
    camera calibration provides the orientation and position of the calibration
    plane. </li>
  <li>It also requires that changes to the background to remain as minimal as
    possible. This is required for the automatic selection process. </li>
  <li>It is recommneded that the calibration board not be rotated more than 45
    degrees about its orthogonal axis. </li>
  <li>Finally, the board's position should be moved around as much as possible
    throughout the dataset. </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>INSTALL<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>After unzipping the file to folder <i>installfolder</i>, add the
directory to the Matlab path:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&gt;&gt;addpath('<i>installfolder</i>'); savepath;</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>GETTING STARTED<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png"
border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>To begin the calibration, set the Matlab path to the path containing
the laser data and the file 'Calib_Results.mat' output by the camera
calibration. Then, type <em>RADLOCC</em> at the Matlab command
line.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>The following dialog should pop up.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="maindiag.jpg" width="887" height="90"></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>The following steps introduce a quick start to performing a
calibration:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Press <em>Read data</em>. Enter the file names (Refer to the DATA FORMAT
    section for details about the format of the calibration dataset). Reading
    the data may take some time depending on the size of the data. Fortunately,
    after the data is read, the user can press <em>Save</em> to save the data
    and use <em>Load</em> next time for quicker loading times.</li>
  <li>Press <em>Auto select</em>. The program will ask for two threshold
    values: rough line threshold and fine line threshold. The line extraction
    stage of the automatic selection process requires two thresholds (refer to
    the RADLOCC technical report for further details). The rough threshold is
    used for obtaining the intial estimate for the calibration and the fine
    threshold is used for the final optimisation. The selection of these values
    will depend on the quality of the laser range finder, the default values
    should be fine for a SICK laser. The program will then ask whether the user
    wants the program to attempt to guess the initial estimate. Select
    <em>yes</em> or manually enter the intial estimate. The program will then
    run an optimisation to find the boards in the laser scans. Finally, the
    user might be asked to verify some lines suspiciously extracted and/or to
    manually select the board from laser scans with no boards extracted.</li>
  <li>Press <em>Calibrate</em> to obtain the calibration results with
    uncertainty. The uncertainty values represent the estimated standard
    deviation of the errors.</li>
  <li>The calibration process should be complete; however, there might be need
    for refining the calibration. For visual inspection, press <em>Laser onto
    image</em> to reproject the laser scans onto the images. </li>
  <li>The <em>Analyse error</em> feature displays the error for each extracted
    board. This feature can be used with <em>Add/Suppress scans</em> option to
    remove outlier scans.</li>
  <li>Verify the results by reprojecting the laser scans onto the images. This
    can be done by pressing <em>Laser onto image</em> and then selecting the
    image numbers. What is important to notice is the consistency between the
    range jumps of the laser scan and edges in the image as shown below.</li>
</ol>

<h2>IMPROVING THE CALIBRATION<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png"
border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The calibration results can be adjusted/improved by one of the
following methods:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Manually selecting some boards in the laser scans at the end of the
    automatic selection process. The auto selection process might remove some
    valid board scans. This reduce the amount of data available for
    calibration. Manually selecting these scans might improve the calibration
    resutls.</li>
  <li>Suppressing outlier scans. For various reasons, some scans might appear
    as an outlier while analysing the errors. Suppressing these scans might
    improve the results.</li>
  <li>Changing the line thresholds. The default line thresholds were tuned for
    SICK lasers. The accuracy of other laser range finders might differ.
    Therefore, the toolbox might fail to detect laser boards in such scans. Two
    thresholds are used, rough and fine. The rough threshold is used to permit
    the program to successfully obtain an initial estimate for the calibration
    since a fine threshold might remove alot of board points. The fine
    threshold on the other hand, is used to remove noise from board scans and
    reduce error in the calibration.</li>
  <li>By choosing to <em>Manually select</em> (this does not use any automatic
    extraction) the laser board scans.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>DATA FORMAT<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The Laser data file is assumed to be in ascii format. Two files are
expected. The first file contains the laser range data. The second file
contains the timestamps of the images used in the camera calibration. In the
first file each row should correspond to a laser scan. The format of each line
should be as follows:</strong></p>

<p>&lt;timestamp&gt; StartAngleRads AngleIncrementRads EndAngleRads
RangeUnitType NoAngles [Ranges]</p>

<p><strong>The second file contains the timestamps for the images used in the
camera calibration sorted in a column.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>CALIBRATION PARAMETERS<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png"
border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>A point in 3D space with coordinate vector P<sub>c</sub> with
respect to the camera has coordinate vector P<sub>l</sub> in the laser frame.
The two <strong>vectors can be related by the following
equation:</strong></strong></p>

<p>P<sub>l</sub>=&Phi;(P<sub>c</sub>-&Delta;)</p>

<p><strong>where</strong> &Delta; <strong>is the translation offset
and</strong> &Phi; <strong>is the rotation matrix defined by the set of three
Euler angles</strong> &phi;<sub>x</sub>, &phi;<sub>y</sub> <strong>and</strong>
&phi;<sub>z</sub><strong>.</strong> </p>

<p>&Phi; <strong>defines the rotation that takes the camera frame to the laser
frame. It is a combination of three rotations (the order is important). The
first is a rotation about the x axis by the angle
</strong>&phi;<sub>x</sub><strong>, the second is about the (possibly new) y
axis by the angle </strong>&phi;<sub>y</sub> <strong>and the last is that about
the (again possibly new) z axis by the angle
</strong>&phi;<sub>z</sub><strong>. </strong>&Delta; <strong>is simply the
coordinates of the vector extending from the camera origin to the laser origin
in the camera&rsquo;s coordinate frame. </strong></p>
