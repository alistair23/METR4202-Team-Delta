<h1>The Automatic Board Selection Algorithm</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The goal of the RADLOCC algorithm is the automatic extraction of
calibration board lines from 2D laser scans. Extrinsic laser-camera calibration
based on observing a well defined object requires the extraction of that object
from the laser scans (this is also true for the camera). Rather than relying
manual extraction, the RADLOCC algorithm was proposed to achieve the automatic
extraction of chessboard calibration boards &ndash; which are the calibration
object of choice. This page briefly mentions key ideas in the algorithm; for a
detailed explanation, please refer to the RADLOCC technical report.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>STRAIGHT LINE CRITERIA<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png"
border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>The proposed straight line criteria is that a set of consecutive
points in the laser scan is considered a straight line if the maximum distance
from any point of that set to the straight line formed by joining the end
points is less than a certain threshold. The figure below visualises the
criteria. The red line is the line formed by joining the end points. The black
lines represent the distances to be tested. The maximum distance should be less
than a certain threshold. In the RADLOCC algorithm, two thresholds are used for
two different purposes. When finding the initial estimate, a loose threshold of
5cm is used. This is necessary to include as many board lines as possible, even
if they are noisy or include some outlier points from the frame of the
calibration board or persons around. For the following stage however, after the
estimate has been optimised, a tighter threshold is used. This ensures the
removal of outlier points and noisy board scans.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>REFINEMENT OF INITIAL ESTIMATE<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png"
border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>One of the metrics used for the classification process is the extent
of match to the initial estimate of the transformation. In other words,
assuming an initial estimate of the transformation exists, each laser scan is
transformed to the camera plane and the distance of each point in the scan from
the calibration board is measured. Depending on the accuracy of the initial
estimate, the score will vary in its ability to signify the calibration line.
Therefore, a refinement loop is applied to improve the estimate of the
transformation. Initially, data points are selected based on frequency and
length metrics only. These data points are used to obtain a rough initial
estimate, which is then incorporated in the classification process which may
choose a different set of data points. This is repeated until the data points
selected do not change. Once convergence is reached, the data points are used
for the final optimisation of the calibration using the last initial estimate
obtained.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION<a href="#_top"><img alt="^" src="up.png" border="0"></a></h2>

<div class="box">
<p><strong>After straight lines are extracted they are subject to a
classification process which selects the correct calibration board line. The
metrics used for the classification process are:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The initial estimate (if available)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The frequency of the point range.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The length of the lines.</strong></li>
</ol>
